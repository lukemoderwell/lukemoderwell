title: "Day 1: Switching to Gatsby"
---

Keeping a semi-regular journal of my progress on this site mainly to reflect and stay motivated. [v2 of my site](v2.lukemoderwell.com) was an experimental static site build mainly with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and supposed to be a minimalist setup. While very small in footprint, it wasn't great at supporting some of the things I wanted from a site (namely an easy place to write) so I am switching over to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) + [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)-powered static site. Same principles still apply; must be simple to update, fun to work on, and easy to maintain. So far today, I've switched to branch-subdomains, setup SCSS processing and ported over my old homepage and some early writing. More to come soon.

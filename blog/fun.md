title: "Getting A Job In Tech: 5 Lessons I've Learned"
descritption: 5 things I wish I knew when I was starting out in product design,
  front-end engineering, and more.
---
Recently I was helping coach a young developer trying to get their first job in the tech industry. They were breaking in from a non-traditional background (music major, no bootcamp or experience programming at any level) and beginning to get disheartened by the process of constantly putting themselves out there in search of a job. Tech is a competitive field and the attractive benefits of better work-life-balance, high salaries, and freedom to work remotely only amplify people's interest level.

I thought back to my own unconventional journey to the world of software development and realized I had some perspective. After barely graduating from college with a degree in entrepreneurship (yes, that was a real major) + Chinese language study then beginning to work in non-tech related fields, I eventually was fortunate enough to find my way into design and development. Here are 5 lessons I've learned so far:

### Find The Edges

In Permaculture (link), an ecological design framework, there is a terminology called the [edge effect](https://www.permaculturenews.org/2016/08/31/defining-edge-simple-terms/) which says that the area where two differing types of environments meet (think a swamp on the edge of a grassland) is the richest and most diverse animal life. In my career, I've inadvertently been able to find edges and learn how to live there which I believe has helped me flourish. The biggest and most lucrative one has been the edge between design and engineering.

### Generalize Early, Specialize Later

* Could also be called:
* Specialization too early on makes switching costs more expensive.
* Generalists are more helpful to small and mid-sized tech companies which is more likely than not where you will work.
* Generalizing gives you a wider net and more opportunity to find your "multiplier"
* Metaphor of sculpting vs painting. In sculpting, you are uncovering something that is already there. Strengths are there but need to be discovered.

**From Chaplain** **Reflections** 

A day at the W House is a roller coaster ride. And yesterday was no exception. The extremes struck me as I drove home. 

On one end of the extremes was a man named Joe. He resides on the 4th floor with others that have some mental challenges. We were having a group discussion with about 10 women on the fourth floor about their ability to love one another like sisters when Joe did the unpredictable. 

When I arrived on the 4th floor, I had seen Joe, a big, muscular man walking around the floor in his navy blue sweat suit, looking like a football player in the weight room. There are not many male residents at W House and very few people who aren’t in wheelchairs. Joe was a rarity. 

When I asked him if he was joining the group in the common room, he looked a little disturbed and just grunted. I guess that meant no. 

Chaplain L handed out a black and white picture to the women in the group of a boy, a girl and a dog sitting under a tree gazing into the distance. The picture really resonated with the group as they discussed the “protection” the boy symbolized and the “unconditional love” of the dog. I was amazed at the depth of the conversation when I saw Joe out of the corner of my eye walk into the common room. He walked over to the bookshelf in the corner and peed on it. And he didn’t pee lightly. He stood there for a good while leaving a massive puddle on the floor. I think I was the only one who noticed as the group continued their discussion. 

Because Joe was standing in the puddle, his sandals tracked pools of urine as he walked away non-chalantly. On the other extreme was a lady named Maurine. I greeted her on the second floor right after she had completed a lecture to others on how to grow plants. Maurine let me know she was a “New Yorker, through and through” as she fussed with the controls on her electric wheelchair. More than anything she wanted to establish with me that she was able to grow all types of plants with her knowledge. 

“Plants create really healthy air, so it’s important that we grow them here,” she contended. “I just got done with a class, where I was showing the group how they too can grow plants from little shoots. And I think I got a few folks interested in starting their own plant collection in their rooms.” 

Maurine was clearly industrious, happily cutting shavings from her plants and starting new plants with others. She gave me a little lecture on all the different plants she owned and when they bloomed and what they looked like. She clearly cared. 

At the end of the day, Chaplain L and I were discussing the day’s activities. I never know what to expect. But one thing becoming clearer to me is the positive impact when people have purpose and hope. I certainly saw it in the extremes of the day. 

**Proverbs 13:12 – Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.**

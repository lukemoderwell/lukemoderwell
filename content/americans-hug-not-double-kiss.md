I was over at the local Sports Complex at 11PM last night. My sons had a game. While I was there I saw some of my old Russian friends, Uri and Igor, two men I played soccer with for 20 years on a Greek club team that disbanded 2 years ago. Ironically, in the last 5 years of our team’s existence, there were no Greek players on our team. Instead, the team was made up first generation Russians, Mexicans, Hondurans and me.

Greeting one another before a game was awkward. In the tradition of some European cultures, they wanted to kiss each team member on each cheek when they met. The Mexicans and Hondurans talked to the team manager about stopping the practice which he handled beautifully, with no hurt feelings. But somehow, perhaps because I looked more like them, the Russians thought it was still ok to try to give me the double kiss. When we got to know each other well enough, I was able to tease them that the double kiss was only for gymnastics, not soccer, and they got the message.

Uri used to tell me about his life as we’d warm up for games or as we would walk slowly to the parking lot afterwards. It turns out that Uri was a member of the Moldovan national team, a great player in the history of their country. After his prime playing years he decided to take his family to America, forgoing a life of luxury and adulation.

Igor, a decent player, also came to America to “make some money, you know.” Igor owns a Taxi Cab company, which he “inherited” when his friend Anatoli (Toni) was extradited when it was found out that he was involved in some unsavory business dealings. Igor always let me know that “Russians good cab drivers, know where things is.” One thing I know for sure, is the sight of some of our players being dropped off at our games in taxi cabs created a great game day diversion. The Serbian or Assyrian or Polish teams seemed confused whether this meant the players were so good they couldn’t be bothered with driving or if they were so poor they couldn’t afford a car. Both were true to some extent.

On more than one occasion, we’d start the game short handed, only to have a cab drive up and three player get out and run onto the field. Usually 3 or 4 goals would follow with accusations that our manager called some friends and offered “big dollars” to have these professionals rushed to our game. The reality was that often traffic was so bad that it took them 90 minutes to travel the 20 miles to get to our game.

I hadn’t thought about Uri for a while, his life a true sacrifice for his family. The contrast of his life before and after moving to America was:

Moldova – National soccer star, with lifetime income and job security, rich by 
Moldovan standards vs. America – manual laborer hanging drywall for a piece rate living paycheck to paycheck.

Moldova – Beautiful wife and two children, supportive family and friends including country dignitaries and leaders vs. America - few friends and a country that hears his accent and thinks of Russian bad guys like Drago in Rocky IV.

Moldova – Estate in the country for weekends and long vacations vs. America – a two room apartment in a fringe neighborhood.

So why did Uri come to America, for a tough life full of back-breaking labor?

“I came to America for good life for children. Home not many jobs and people no happy. I want for children good school and job…..better life,  yes,” he explained. “I work hard for family.”

Over the years, Uri would show up to games with the powder of wall board all over his face and the deterioration of his lung capacity becoming apparent as he bent at the waist gasping for air while spitting up thick white saliva. He was still so good that the other team would typically foul him as hard as legally possible every time he’d touch the ball. Despite this he was a humble and respectful person, never getting upset.

“Children play inside too much, always the tv,” he shared with me after one game as his wife stood by silently. “Not soccer for them, not good at school, so I don’t know if decision good.”

“But Uri, kids don’t appreciate the sacrifices of their parents or all their blessings when they are young. It will work out, give it time,” I’d encourage him, his wife affirming my comments.

“We see…don’t know, yes hope,” he would say raising his palms and scrunching his head downwards.

Last night, I introduced him to one of my sons who was suiting up for his game. Yuri nodded and said, “his face look like Russian, you know?” I told him he was very much a typical American high schooler, involved in lots of activities. I asked him how his family was doing and he looked incredibly tired as he weakly said things were “good.” He followed up by saying, “very busy kids, wife in school too, like typical American.”

We finished our conversation and he quickly moved to hug me. Then he said laughing, “kiss only in gymnastics, yes.”

“Uri, you have become so American.” I waved to him as he walked away smiling, looking for Igor’s cab to take him home to his family.

<p><a href="http://kiwilive.com" target="_blank"><strong>Kiwi Live</strong></a> is an event interaction platform that lets event attendees interact with speaker content and make meaningful connections with their peers. I met Jeff Mason, founder of the Kiwi Live, after a design keynote I gave at a local tech accelerator. Jeff had a working app (built using Rails) and wanted to start focusing more heavily on user experience which was critical to the success of his product.</p>

<p>One constaint of the project was the fact that Kiwi Live is currently web-based software but the critical user experience took place on mobile devices. We weren't able to offer iOS-like affordances such as navigation systems, native animation performance, and features like push notification but may be coming in the future. </p>

<p>I was also able to work on the desktop experience which is a dashboard to help attendees remember content and network with possible connections that they didn't get enough time with during the event. We prioritized quick and easy ways to contact people because of user feedback that said meeting people was a top concern.</p>

<p>I loved working on the Kiwi Live project because of it's challenges but also because I knew how much this product means to its founder. </p>

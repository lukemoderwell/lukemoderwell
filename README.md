# What Is This?

I've often struggled with personal websites. Are they show pieces meant for showing the world (and potential employers) your chops? Are they supposed to be little slices of DIY art and self expression? 

I think the fact that there is no standard definition of what these personal sites should be is what makes them so hard to design. Constraints bring freedom and act as guidelines that make a blank canvas approachable.

This site should:

- [ ] give the viewer an accurate sense of my personality and taste
- [ ] have a journal-like component where I can quickly post thoughts
- [ ] showcase past professional work
- [ ] be a place where I can experiment with new technologies/design patterns
- [ ] have some educational value for others
